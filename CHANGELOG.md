# [v4.0.1](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji/releases/tag/v4.0.1) - 29 Oct 2023

- Fix type definitions ([#29](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji/issues/29))
  - This plugin is for transforming mdast (Markdown AST). Now it is explicitly defined as the 2nd type parameter of `unified.Plugin`.
  - `@types/mdast` and `unified` are now runtime dependencies. This ensures that the correct versions of those packages are referred by TypeScript compiler.
